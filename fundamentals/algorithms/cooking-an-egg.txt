Fill a saucepan with cold water. The water should be about an inch above the egg.
Gently place the egg in the water. You can use a spoon to do this.
Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat.
Once the water is boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3-4 minutes for a soft-boiled egg, or 6-8 minutes for a hard-boiled egg.
Remove the egg from the water with a slotted spoon and place it in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process.
Once the egg is cool, peel it and enjoy!
Here are some additional tips for cooking eggs:

Use older eggs. Older eggs are easier to peel than fresh eggs.
Add a teaspoon of vinegar to the water. This will help to prevent the egg from cracking.
Don't overcook the eggs. Overcooked eggs will have a rubbery texture and a green ring around the yolk.
If you're making hard-boiled eggs, you can add them to the water before it boils. This will help to prevent the eggs from cracking.
You can also cook eggs in the microwave. However, this method is not recommended as it can be difficult to control the cooking time and the egg may explode.
