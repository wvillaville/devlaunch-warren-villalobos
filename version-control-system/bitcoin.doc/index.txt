What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, a virtual currency designed to act as money and a form of payment outside
the control of any one person, group, or entity, thus removing the need for third-party involvement in
financial transactions. It is rewarded to blockchain miners for verifying transactions and
can be purchased on several exchanges.

Bitcoin's Blockchain Technology

Cryptocurrencies are part of a blockchain and the network required to power it. 
A blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database that stores data. 
Encryption methods secure data within the blockchain. 
When a transaction takes place on the blockchain, information from the previous block is copied to a new block with the new data, 
encrypted, and validators verify the transaction—called miners—in the network. 
When a transaction is verified, a new block is opened, and a Bitcoin is created and given as a reward to the miner(s) 
who verified the data within the block—they are then free to use it, hold it, or sell it.

Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. 
Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit hexadecimal number. 
That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.
